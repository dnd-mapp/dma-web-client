### Added

-  **Development Tooling & Standards:**
   -  `README.md` for project overview, installation, and usage instructions.
   -  `LICENSE` file for open-source terms.
   -  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to establish community guidelines.

   -  `SUPPORT.md` outlining how to get help and report issues.
   -  `SECURITY.md` providing guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities.
   -  Pull Request and Issue Templates (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`) to streamline contributions.
   -  `.gitignore` for proper version control.
   -  `.tool-versions` file for consistent Node.js version management (via `mise-en-place` locally and GitHub Workflows).
   -  **Code Quality:**
      -  Prettier and `prettier-plugin-organize-imports` for automated code formatting (`.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`).
      -  ESLint and `angular-eslint` for enforcing linting standards.
-  **Testing Infrastructure:**
   -  Replaced Karma/Jasmine with Vitest (via `@analogjs/vitest-angular`) for unit testing.
   -  Enabled browser-based unit testing using `@vitest/browser` and Playwright.
   -  Configured code coverage reporting (without enforcing thresholds initially).
   -  Integrated Playwright for robust End-to-End (E2E) testing.
-  **Local Development Experience:**
   -  Local development server now defaults to HTTPS using self-signed certificates generated by `mkcert`.
-  **Deployment & CI/CD:**
   -  Docker containerization support for consistent environments.
   -  GitHub Workflow for Continuous Integration (CI):
      -  Validates linting, formatting, building, and unit tests on all pull requests.
      -  Runs E2E tests and creates a `latest` Docker image upon merge to `main`.
   -  GitHub Workflow for Release Automation:
      -  Automates version bumping in `package.json`.
      -  Creates Git tags and GitHub releases with new versions.
      -  Builds and tags Docker images with the release version.

### Changed

-  **Application Structure Refactor:**
   -  Reorganized the boilerplate Angular application for better modularity:
      -  `app.routes.ts` and `app.config.ts` moved to `app/core/config`.
      -  `app.ts` renamed to `root.component.ts` (along with its selector `dma-root`).
      -  The `RootComponent` itself was moved to `app/core/root`.
   -  Replaced the default Angular generated app template.
-  **Test Implementation:**
   -  Refactored `RootComponent`'s tests to leverage Angular CDK component harnesses, enhancing test stability and readability.
   -  Added `RootHarness` (`test/harnesses/core/root.harness.ts`) for easier testing of the root component.

### Removed

-  Karma and Jasmine testing frameworks.
-  Default Angular application template content.
