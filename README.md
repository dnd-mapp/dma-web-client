## About the Project

This Angular application serves as a single-page interface to interact with the D&D Mapp platform. On this platform, Players and Dungeon Masters will be able to:

- Manage their Player Characters.
- Manage notes.
- Keep track of world lore, NPCs, and info.
- Join other players of the same campaign in battles on the virtual tabletop.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v22) and npm (Node Package Manager, v11)**: We recommend using [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage your installed version of Node.js and npm globally.
*   **Angular CLI**: Install globally using npm
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli@~20
    ```
*   **[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)**: Create a new local CA
    ```bash
    mkcert -install
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dnd-mapp/dma-web-client.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd dma-web-client
    ```
3.  **(Optional when using mise-en-place) Install project tools**
    ```bash
    mise install
    ```
4.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

### Configuration and certificates

This application may require certain configuration files to be set up.

1.  **Copy the `public/config-template.json` file and rename it to `config.json`:** Make sure to update it so that the client communicates to the correct server.

    Example `public/config.json`:
    ```json
    {
        "authServerBaseUrl": "https://localhost.auth.dndmapp.dev:4300/server",
        "resourcesServerBaseUrl": "https://localhost.resources.dndmapp.dev:4400/server",
        "playerServerBaseUrl": "https://localhost.player.dndmapp.dev:4500/server"
    }
    ```

2.  **Generate a self-signed certificate to serve the application over HTTPS:** The app is served locally over HTTPS by default. In order to accomplish this you must generate a self-signed certificate using mkcert.
    ```bash
    mkcert -cert-file certificate.pem -key-file certificate-key.pem localhost.www.dndmapp.dev localhost
    ```

3.  **Trust the certificate:** In order to prevent HTTPS warnings from your browser you must add them as trusted certificates. Follow the steps below for your Operating System:
    -  For Windows:
       1.  Press <kbd>&#8862; Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to open `Run`.
       2.  Type `mmc` and press <kbd>‚èé Enter</kbd> to open `Microsoft Management Console` (You may need to accept that this app may make changes to your device).
       3.  Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> to add or remove Snap-ins.
       4.  Add the `Certificates` snap-in, confirm that it'll manage certificates for your user account, and confirm the selection of snap-ins.
       5.  In the side panel, navigate to `Console Root > Certificates - Current User > Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates`.
       6.  In the top bar, open the `Action` menu, open the `All Tasks` sub menu, and select the `Import...` task.
       7.  Click on next to confirm that the store location is for the `Current User`.
       8.  Click on `Browse...`, navigate to the repository root folder, allow all file types, and select the `certificate.pem`.
       9.  Continue and finish by placing the certificate under the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store (There's no need to save the console settings).
    
    -  For all Operating Systems: You need to restart your browser after trusting the certificate to complete the process.

4.  **Update the hosts file:** To be able to use the custom host names you need to update the hosts file. Follow the steps below for your Operating System:
    -  The following contents will need to be added to the Hosts file, no matter the OS of your device:
       ```text
       127.0.0.1    localhost.www.dndmapp.dev
       ```

    -  For Windows:
       1.  Run a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++ as Administrator.
       2.  Open the Hosts file on the following location: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
       3.  Add the contents from above in the file, save, and close the file.
